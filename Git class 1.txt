What is a Version?
Each update or change in our code creates a new version.
There are different conventions of naming the version
e.g V0, V0.1, V0.2
V0, V1 ,V2
V0, V0.1 ,V1,V1.1< V1.2


Why do we need GIT?
We need GIt to make our life easy
It helps us to manage our versions on a our laptop locally!

If we donot use git then
it gets very hard to manage all the versions
the space consumed is also big
and its hard for us to find any code because they are not properly managed.



●	We learned why do we need Git and Github and how it makes our life easy and helps us work together in collaboration
○	Git is just one of the VCT, there are other popular SVN
○	Why to use GIT? —> to collaborate with teams
○	When you work in a team on the same file/project —> it is very helpful and useful
